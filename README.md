# fun-html-page
Inspired from a reel I saw on instagram, where everyone was asking for the code, I decided to spend an afternoon making this and learning the basics of html and css in the process.

If you are unfamilira with how to run html an html file:
1. download the file "index.html" by pulling this repository
2. you should be able to run it by just double-clicking and opening it in your prefer browser.
